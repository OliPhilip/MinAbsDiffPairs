=============

LinkedIn discussion in Algorithms and Data Structures Development's group started by Ramkumar S.

All codes are done from scratch except Mersenne twister borrowed from

Hash table solution initiated by Hillel Gazit, fixed by John Boyer.

note
-------------

I skipped the displaying / storing of pairs, just finding and counting instead.

compilation
-------------

GNU GCC compiler following C++11 ISO standanrd (-std=C++11).

Other meaningful option: fully optimized for speed (-O3).
